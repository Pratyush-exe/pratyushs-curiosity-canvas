              I'm Pratyush, and I've dedicated my career to pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI and technology. 
              From building ML systems at <span className="text-primary font-semibold">JP Morgan Chase</span> to leading AI initiatives at 
              <span className="text-primary font-semibold"> betterhalf.ai</span>, I've always been driven by curiosity and the desire to innovate.

              where I've built drones, experimented with rocket propulsion (with some explosive results!), and spent countless hours 
              chasing the next breakthrough.

              Currently, I'm working on what I believe will be the next major leap in personal computing: 
              <span className="text-gradient font-semibold"> smart glasses that reimagine how we interact with intelligence and information</span>. 
              It's not just about building technologyâ€”it's about creating the future we've always imagined.
